My project is mushroom classification. In my project , there are about 2 categories (edible or poisonous) and 8124 records (52% edible and 48% poisonous).
For my project, I have tried three machine learning models:
SVM , Random forest and logistic regression. 
All three models have good performances:
Compare recall, precision, f1-score for both class
F1_score > 95%
Accuracy > 95%

This dataset includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus 
and Lepiota Family Mushroom drawn from The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms (1981). 
Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended. 
This latter class was combined with the poisonous one. The Guide clearly states that there is no simple rule for determining the edibility of a mushroom; 
no rule like "leaflets three, let it be'' for Poisonous Oak and Ivy.
